## Inference

推断在现代地理学的计算中是很重要的一个方面。

比如，在Cortes et al. (2020) 的工作中，就对传统的random labeling approach进行了扩展，可以对（不同时间或同一时间的）不同区域的segregation index 进行统计推断：

The major contribution of our framework is the ability to perform inference to compare more than one segregation measure. To do so, we extend (Rey and Sastré-Gutiérrez, 2010), who provide an inferential basis for comparisons of regional statistics. Their approach relies on a **random labeling approach**, where in each permutation, each unit in the dataset is assigned randomly to a point in time. However, our approach for comparative segregation stands as more generic and may be applied in any situation where two spatial contexts are compared. 

Cortes et al. (2020) 举了两个例子。

For example, a user can compare the evolution of a single region between two points in time, two regions in the same point in time, and, also, two regions between two points in time. The first case is a straightforward adaptation of (Rey and Sastré-Gutiérrez, 2010), but the second differs, given the possibility that each region may have entirely different spatial contexts. 

为了解决问题，作者提出，

To try to provide alternative ways to assess the absence of segregation difference, our framework comprises not only a random data labeling (“random label” approach), but also a labeling process that randomizes observations according to the cumulative distribution function representing the population share for the group of interest in each unit (“counterfactual composition” approach).
